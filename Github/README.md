## Usage

In addition to the basic skills, the course provided a instructions for running Git commands via Bash and performing advanced version control tasks.
During the course, an interesting project involved collaborative work on the lyrics of the song "Wind of Change" by the band Scorpions. Changes to the song's lyrics were made using GitBash commands, demonstrating the practical use of version control in a creative context.
